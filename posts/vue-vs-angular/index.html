<p>As a media engineering student, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of front-end JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Two of the most popular ones are Angular and Vue. Both Angular and Vue are powerful tools for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, but they have some key differences that make them better suited for certain types of projects.</p>
<p>Angular is a complete framework that provides a lot of built-in features and tools for building large-scale, complex web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which makes it easy to organize and manage the different parts of your application. Angular also comes with a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that makes it easy to set up and manage projects, as well as a wide range of built-in directives and services that can save you a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Vue is a lighter-weight library that is better suited for smaller, simpler projects. It follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which makes it more flexible and easier to learn than Angular. Vue also has a smaller learning curve and it is more approachable to developers who are new to JavaScript frameworks. Vue comes with a powerful set of tools and directives, such as v-if and v-for, which make it easy to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, Vue is faster than Angular because of its smaller size and simpler design. Vue&rsquo;s reactivity system is also easier to understand and use than Angular&rsquo;s change detection mechanism. Vue also has a smaller bundle size, which means that it takes less time to download and load your application, which is especially important for mobile users.</p>
<p>In terms of scalability and maintainability, Angular is a better choice for large-scale projects. Angular&rsquo;s structure and architecture make it easier to organize and manage large code bases. Angular also has a large and active community, which means that there are many resources and tutorials available to help you learn and troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a comparison table of the two frameworks:</p>

<p>This article is really about being able to compare frameworks and figuring out which is best for what project. I decided to use different formats of sources for this article. I really like watching Fireship&rsquo;s videos and thought of this one when I was thinking about what to write about. Despite the look of the blog (thanks Reader Mode), I also like the infographic from Hackernoon because it&rsquo;s a good visual representation of the differences between the frameworks. Same for DoNotApply&rsquo;s article, both Medium articles are pretty similar but I thought it was good to see the point of view of different authors.</p>
