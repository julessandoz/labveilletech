As a media engineering student, I've been learning a lot about web development and the different aspects that come with it. From coding best practices to time management, there are many things to consider when trying to improve as a developer. In this article, I'll be sharing some tips and tricks that I've found to be particularly useful in my own journey to becoming a better developer.

## 1. Master the basics

One of the most important things to keep in mind as a developer is to master the basics of the language you're working with. This is especially true for JavaScript, as it has many quirks and features that can trip you up if you're not familiar with them. In the article "15 Tips to Improve as a Javascript Developer," some great tips are provided to help you master the basics of JavaScript. For example, you can use the ternary operator to write a one-liner if/else statement, like this

```jsx
let age = 25;
let canDrink = (age >= 21) ? 'Can drink' : 'Cannot drink';
console.log(canDrink);
```

## 2. Take feedback seriously

Another important aspect of improving as a developer is being open to feedback. In the article "Why Some Developers Will Never Improve," it's explained that feedback can be the major catalyst that propels developers forward in their career and levels up their skillset. However, it's not just about being open to feedback, but also about actively applying it to your work.

When receiving feedback, make sure to ask questions if you have any, take notes, retroactively apply the advice to your previous code, and echo it to others. By doing this, you'll not only be incorporating the feedback but also gaining a deeper understanding of the lesson learned.

## 3. Keep your code clean

Clean code is essential to being a good developer. Not only does it make it easier for others to understand and work with your code, but it also makes it easier for you to maintain and update it in the future. In the article "Three “Clean Code” tips that will make your dev team 50% more efficient," some great tips are provided to help you keep your code clean. For example, use good names that reveal the intent of the code, avoid functions side effects, and comment only when necessary.

## 4. Develop good habits

Finally, the key to becoming a better developer is to develop good habits. In the article "4 Habits That Made Me a Better Developer," it's explained that small changes in your daily routine can have a big impact on your productivity and efficiency as a developer. For example, setting aside time every day to learn something new, using a task manager to keep track of your tasks, and actively seeking out feedback from your peers can all help you to improve as a developer.

In conclusion, becoming a better developer is a continuous journey that requires mastering the basics, taking feedback seriously, keeping your code clean, and developing good habits. By following these tips and tricks, you'll be able to improve your skills and become a more efficient and effective developer. Remember, it's not about being perfect, but about always striving to learn and grow.
