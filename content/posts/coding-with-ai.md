## How I got into AI dev tools

I first got into AI dev tools when a classmate told me about tabnine, an AI-powered code autocomplete tool. I was intrigued and decided to give it a try. After using it for a few days, I was hooked. The tool saved me so much time and made coding more efficient. I started exploring other AI tools for developers and that's when things got serious.

## When things got serious

One morning, I woke up to an email from Github. I had forgotten that I signed up for the waiting list to Copilot, an AI-powered code assistant, and it was finally my turn. I first learned about it in a podcast episode of the French podcast, Underscore. My first impressions were seriously great. I basically used it for everything I did coding-wise and it worked great. Copilot helped me with autocomplete, suggestions for variable names, and even debugging.

## The democratization of AI tools

Unless you’ve been living in a cave, you must have heard about ChatGPT in one way or another. People are talking about a Google-killer, developers claim to be scared for their job, etc… ChatGPT is a powerful AI language model developed by OpenAI. It can be used for a variety of tasks such as natural language processing, text generation, and even coding. As a developer, I use ChatGPT to get inspiration for coding projects, to debug my code, and even to generate code snippets.

## The Good the Bad and the Ugly

When it comes to AI tools for developers like Copilot or ChatGPT, people have been either very critical or full of praise. Obviously no tool is perfect, so how can we, as developers, make good use of AI to be more productive and successful?

Here’s how I use ChatGPT and Copilot when coding and why:

### ChatGPT

#### Dos

- Get inspiration for coding projects
- Debug my code
- Generate code snippets

For example, if I'm working on a project and I'm stuck on how to implement a certain feature, I'll use ChatGPT to generate code snippets that I can use as a starting point.

#### Don’ts

- Generate and use code blindly

It's important to remember that ChatGPT is not a magic wand and should not be used blindly. The code generated may not be efficient or even correct. It's important to always review and test the code before using it in a production environment.

### Copilot

#### Dos

- Autocomplete on steroids

Copilot is great for autocompleting code, suggesting variable names, and even debugging.

#### Don’ts

- Autonomous code generator

Similar to ChatGPT, it's important not to use Copilot as a standalone code generator. The code generated may not be efficient or correct. It's important to always review and test the code before using it in a production environment.

In conclusion, AI development tools such as Github Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT can help developers be more productive, efficient, and successful. However, it is important to remember that these tools should not be used blindly. Developers should be aware of the implications of using these tools and use them responsibly. Additionally, these tools cannot replace human labor and the human element is still necessary for development. 

In summary, AI development tools can be useful, but must be used with caution.
