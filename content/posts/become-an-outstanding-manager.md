<!-- # How to Become an Outsanding Manager in Development and Front-End Engineering -->

Being a manager in development and front-end engineering can be a challenging task. However, by understanding the common pitfalls and best practices, you can become an outstanding leader for your team.

## Acquiring Technical Skills

First, it's essential to treat management as a technical skill that must be acquired. Many new managers overlook the need to study management in the same way they might learn a new framework or language. As a novice manager, it's important to identify people and their behaviors you want to emulate, and practice discovering your voice by doing role-play with a colleague or manager.

## People Leadership

New managers often struggle with people leadership. Take the time to reflect on the leaders and people you admire, and consider what kind of manager you would like to be. Every manager has their own style, but once you become a leader, your words and actions will be closely scrutinized. Observe the people and behaviours you want to learn from. Again, you can practice finding your voice by role-playing with a peer or manager to gain confidence in your leadership style.

## Smart Team Composition

Secondly, having a suitable team composition is critical. When constructing a team, a lot of value is often placed on the potential team members' skills, but some qualities are much more important, particularly when you are looking for long-term reinforcement for the team. These qualities are potential and personality. Potential should be given special consideration because it represents an opportunity for further development. And, naturally, it works especially well when people have a strong enthusiasm for what they do.

## Communicate Clearly

Another essential aspect of management is communication. As a manager, it's essential to communicate effectively with your team. You need to set clear objectives, provide regular feedback, and create a culture of open communication. It's also important to be a good listener and be responsive to your team's needs.

## Learning from your Mistakes

Mistakes are an inevitable part of the management process and should be seen as opportunities for growth and development. However, it is essential to not repeat the same mistakes and take the necessary steps to prevent them from happening again. As a manager, it is important to be open to constructive criticism and use it as an opportunity to improve. Seek feedback from your team and use it to identify areas for improvement. Take the time to reflect on your actions and decisions and think about what you could have done differently. Remember, the key to becoming a better manager is to continuously learn and grow from your mistakes.

## Code Review Process

Lastly, the code review process is a key part of management in development and front-end engineering. A quality code review process will help you to create a code quality gate, spread knowledge across developers, get a collective opinion about the implementation, and maintain a consistent source code style. To achieve this, it's necessary to have a code review checklist, automate all possible checks, and make the pipeline a reviewer.

In conclusion, being a manager in development and front-end engineering requires learning, understanding the importance of team composition, communication, mistakes, and code review process. By following best practices and avoiding common pitfalls, you can become an exemplary leader for your team.
